Solution: AI-Powered Motorized Solar Scarecrow A solar-powered, autonomous scarecrow that detects, tracks, and repels birds and animals using motion, sound, and light-based deterrents. This system runs entirely on renewable energy and requires minimal human intervention.  Core Features & How It Works: 1️⃣ Solar-Powered Motorized Movement The scarecrow is equipped with solar panels to power its motion and sensors. Uses servo motors and actuators to move its arms and head in unpredictable patterns, preventing birds from adapting. 2️⃣ AI-Powered Motion Detection & Object Recognition Integrated AI cameras and motion sensors identify approaching birds and pests. Uses machine learning to differentiate between harmful pests (e.g., crows, rodents) and harmless animals (e.g., cows, farm dogs). 3️⃣ Smart Deterrence System Ultrasonic sound emitters that create high-frequency noises inaudible to humans but disturbing for birds and rodents. Rotating reflective surfaces and flashing LED lights to startle birds at night. A speaker system that mimics predator sounds (e.g., hawks, owls) when a threat is detected. 5️⃣ Weather Adaptability & Remote Control Rainproof and dustproof for long-term durability.

Near-Infrared (NIR) sensors detect internal spoilage, while thermal imaging identifies bacterial contamination. The system classifies items and a robotic arm sorts them for packaging, processing, or waste. This innovation improves food safety, reduces waste, and enhances quality control in food processing, supermarkets, and smart farming industries.",N/A,19,Undergraduate University (3+ year),1,1,1,9944835713,Yesss!!,Not Submitted,N/A,rsvp,"[""N/A""]"
